A step towards learning Github


Like most hello-world programs , this repository is meant to mark the starting of understanding Github and exploring it to the core.

I am enthusiatic about learning new technologies,esp in the field of artificial intelligence. I'm currently pursuing machine learning.
I love watching game of thrones :p and listening to metal. Lamb of God is just too good :D
